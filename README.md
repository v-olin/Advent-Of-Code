# Advent-Of-Code

Monorepo for all my years of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## 2022
New year, new language. This year is written in F#.
```
> dotnet fsi <file>.fsx
```

## 2021
This year I've decided to write it in Haskell. Mostly for practice but great fun!
Different days have different dependencies. So if you want to run the solutions you can try to compile
each day with GHC like this:
```
> ghc <file>.hs
```
Or you can run it in a sandbox of your choice.

## 2020
First year of AOC. Did not finish all days on time but I tried my best. Solutions are written in C# scripts
which can be executed with the [C# REPL Interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2016/january/essential-net-csharp-scripting)
like this:
```
> csi <file>.csx
```

## 2015
Coming up on AOC of 2022, I'm warming up with some older events.
Starting with 2015. This year is written in Java and the
solutions are self-contained. Just run them like this:
```
> java <file>.java
```

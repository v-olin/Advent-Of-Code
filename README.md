# Advent-Of-Code

My repo for all years of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) (that I've done so far). Previously in separated repos but now combined.

## 2021
This year I've decided to write it in Haskell. Mostly for practice but great fun!
Different days have different dependencies. So if you want to run the solutions you can try to compile
each day with GHC like this:
```
> ghc sol.hs
```
Or you can run it in a sandbox of your choice.

## 2020
First year of AOC. Did not finish all days on time but I tried my best. Solutions are written in C# scripts
which can be executed with the [C# REPL Interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2016/january/essential-net-csharp-scripting)
like this:
```
> csi <file>.csx
```
